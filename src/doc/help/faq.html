			<h2>What is Smash Uploader ?</h2>
			<div class="answer">
				Smash Uploader is an OpenSource application coded with Java 1.6, which purpose is to help you to create

			<h2>How to use Smash Uploader ? (step by step)</h2>
			<div class="answer">
				<h3>Logging in / Identification / Token</h3>
				At its first launch, Smash Uploader will ask for your identification. <br />
					
				At any time after that, you will be able to display the identification box again 
				by clicking on the <img src="../../images/user.png" /> icon.<br />
				<br />
				The first field is your email address used with you UpShot account.<br />
				The second field is the identification token you can retrieve at anytime on your UpShot account.<br />
				We use this identification token rather than your usual password to ensure better security.

				<h3>Dropping images</h3>
				Pretty simple in fact...<br />
				Click on an image on your Desktop, and keep the button pressed on it while moving the mouse towards
				the dropzone of Smash Uploader.<br />
				Release the mouse, and that it ! You should see your image appearing in the image list below the dropzone.

				<h3>Managing images files</h3>
					<h4>Deleting</h4>
						If you change your mind for any reason, you can delete an image from the list of images to be sent, 
						by simply clicking on the <img src="../../images/cross.png" /> icon of its row.
					<h4>Editing</h4>
						Before sending an image, you can edit its title, in order not to keep the filename as title of the image.
						There is two way to edit the image title : 
							<ol>
								<li> Simply click on the title field of the image in the list, 
									you'll see an edition cursor appearing. You can change this title as you want.</li>
								<li>At the end of the image row, you can see an <img src="../../images/edit.png" />Edit icon.
						If you click on it, you'll see the edition box to change the title.<br />
						This way is quite better, in the way that it also let you see a thumbnail of your image, in the case you have numerous images, and do not always remeber all of them by filename...</li>
